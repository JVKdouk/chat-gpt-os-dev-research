## Notes on Scheduler

ChatGPT produced enough information for me to blindly implement scheduling. Prior knowledge was needed regarding preemption, since it did not mention enabling the clock IRQ on x86. It was necessary to ask it if it was necessary and how to do it (to which it replied correctly, stating the necessity of clock). It was not able to provide specific details on the implementation, but gave instructions on how to perform it. To my surprise, it gave me external recommendation on how to implement the scheduler and the clock IRQ.

ChatGPT also did not include the idea of the trap frame (process internal state, such as register state). After asking it for the trap frame, it pointed out correctly that storing the trap frame is a common procedure. While developing a scheduler entirely from the output of ChatGPT is feasible, small details may be missing, so constant communication with it is necessary to uncover implementation details.

**Question:** How to write an Operating System Scheduler in Rust?

**Answer:** Here are the high-level steps to write an operating system scheduler in Rust:

1.  Familiarize yourself with the language and its standard library.
2.  Determine the scheduling algorithm you want to implement (e.g. Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc.)
3.  Design the data structures to store the list of processes and their state.
4.  Write functions for adding, removing, and updating processes in the list.
5.  Write the scheduler function that selects the next process to run and updates the process state.
6.  Integrate the scheduler with the rest of the operating system.
7.  Test and debug your implementation.

It's a complex project and you should have a good understanding of operating system concepts and the Rust programming language before attempting to write an operating system scheduler.

**Question:** What info do I need to keep track for every process in a scheduler?

**Answer:** In a scheduler, you need to keep track of the following information for each process:

1.  Process ID (PID) - A unique identifier for the process.
2.  State - The current state of the process (e.g. running, waiting, ready, etc.).
3.  Priority - The priority of the process, used by some scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which processes should be executed.
4.  CPU time - The amount of CPU time used by the process.
5.  Arrival time - The time the process arrived in the ready queue.
6.  Burst time - The amount of CPU time the process needs to complete its task.
7.  Memory usage - The amount of memory used by the process.
8.  I/O requests - Any pending I/O requests for the process.

Note that the exact information you need to keep track of will depend on the specific requirements of your scheduler and the scheduling algorithm you are using.

**Question:** How to implement a round-robin scheduler?

**Answer:** Here's a basic outline of how to implement a Round Robin (RR) scheduler in an operating system:

1.  Create a queue for processes: The scheduler should maintain a queue of processes that are ready to be executed.
2.  Assign time slices: Each process in the queue should be assigned a fixed time slice (also known as a time quantum) for executing on the CPU.
3.  Fetch the next process: The scheduler should fetch the next process from the queue and execute it on the CPU.
4.  Keep track of CPU time: The scheduler should keep track of the amount of CPU time each process has received and interrupt it once its time slice has been used up.
5.  Add the interrupted process back to the queue: The scheduler should add the interrupted process back to the end of the queue to be executed again later.
6.  Repeat the process: The scheduler should repeat the process of fetching the next process from the queue and executing it until there are no more processes in the queue.
7.  Preemption: The scheduler should support preemption, which allows a process to be interrupted and added back to the end of the queue even if its time slice has not been used up.
8.  Aging: The scheduler may implement aging, which adjusts the priority of processes that have been waiting in the queue for a long time.

The implementation details of the Round Robin scheduler can vary based on the specific requirements of the operating system, such as the size of the time slice and the specific data structures used to maintain the queue of processes.

**Question:** How to perform preemption?

**Answer:** Preemption in a Round Robin scheduler allows a process to be interrupted and added back to the end of the queue even if its time slice has not been used up. Here's a basic outline of how to implement preemption:

1.  Interrupt handling: The operating system should have an interrupt handling mechanism that can interrupt a running process and switch to the scheduler.
2.  Check for preemption: The scheduler should periodically check if a preemption event has occurred, such as a higher-priority process becoming ready or an external event requiring the scheduler's attention.
3.  Interrupt the process: If a preemption event has occurred, the scheduler should interrupt the running process and switch to the next process in the queue.
4.  Add the interrupted process back to the queue: The scheduler should add the interrupted process back to the end of the queue to be executed again later.
5.  Repeat the process: The scheduler should repeat the process of fetching the next process from the queue and executing it until there are no more processes in the queue.

The specific implementation details of preemption can vary based on the operating system and the underlying hardware, but the basic concept is the same: to interrupt a running process and switch to the next process in the queue in response to a preemption event.

**Question:** Should I enable clock IRQ in x86 to be able to preempt using time slices?

**Answer:** Yes, in an x86-based operating system, enabling the clock IRQ (Interrupt Request) is necessary to support preemption using time slices in a Round Robin scheduler. The clock IRQ generates periodic interrupts, which the operating system can use to enforce the time slice for each process.

By enabling the clock IRQ, the operating system can periodically check if the running process has used up its time slice, and if so, it can interrupt the process and switch to the next process in the queue. This allows the scheduler to enforce the time slicing policy and ensure that each process receives a fair share of CPU time.

The specific steps for enabling the clock IRQ will depend on the operating system and the underlying hardware, but the basic idea is to configure the timer and IRQ controller to generate the clock IRQ at the desired frequency. The operating system should also register an interrupt handler for the clock IRQ, which will be called whenever a clock IRQ occurs. This interrupt handler can then be used to enforce the time slicing policy and perform preemption.

---

**Question:** How to enable the clock IRQ in x86?

**Answer:** Enabling the clock IRQ in an x86-based operating system typically involves the following steps:

1.  Configure the timer: The operating system needs to configure the timer to generate the clock IRQ at the desired frequency. This is usually done by writing to the timer's control register to set the frequency and start the timer.
2.  Configure the IRQ controller: The operating system also needs to configure the IRQ controller, which is responsible for managing IRQs in the system. The IRQ controller needs to be told which IRQ line to use for the clock IRQ, and the operating system needs to ensure that the clock IRQ is enabled and not masked.
3.  Register the interrupt handler: The operating system should register an interrupt handler for the clock IRQ, which will be called whenever a clock IRQ occurs. This interrupt handler should be responsible for enforcing the time slicing policy and performing preemption.
4.  Enable interrupts: The operating system should enable interrupts in the processor by setting the interrupt flag in the flags register. This allows the processor to handle IRQs and call the interrupt handler when a clock IRQ occurs.

These are the basic steps for enabling the clock IRQ in an x86-based operating system. The specific details will depend on the operating system and the underlying hardware, and may involve additional steps or different approaches. However, the basic idea is to configure the timer and IRQ controller to generate the clock IRQ, and to register an interrupt handler to enforce the time slicing policy and perform preemption.

Can you show some x86 and Rust code to perform this?

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a complete code example in x86 Assembly and Rust for enabling the clock IRQ and implementing a Round Robin scheduler with preemption, as it is a complex task that involves many low-level details specific to the operating system and the underlying hardware.

However, I can provide a high-level outline of the steps involved in implementing a Round Robin scheduler with preemption on an x86-based system using Rust:

1.  Configure the timer: Use the x86 Assembly instructions to configure the timer to generate the clock IRQ at the desired frequency. This typically involves writing to the timer's control register to set the frequency and start the timer.
2.  Configure the IRQ controller: Use the x86 Assembly instructions to configure the IRQ controller to use the desired IRQ line for the clock IRQ and to enable the clock IRQ.
3.  Register the interrupt handler: Use Rust to register an interrupt handler for the clock IRQ. This handler should be written in Rust and should be responsible for enforcing the time slicing policy and performing preemption.
4.  Enable interrupts: Use the x86 Assembly instructions to enable interrupts in the processor by setting the interrupt flag in the flags register. This allows the processor to handle IRQs and call the interrupt handler when a clock IRQ occurs.
5.  Implement the scheduler: Use Rust to implement the Round Robin scheduler, including the queue of processes and the logic for fetching the next process from the queue and executing it. The scheduler should also handle preemption, including interrupting the running process and adding it back to the end of the queue, and switching to the next process in the queue.

This is a high-level outline of the steps involved in implementing a Round Robin scheduler with preemption on an x86-based system using Rust. The specific implementation details and code will depend on the operating system and the underlying hardware, and may require additional steps or different approaches.

**Question:** Should we be storing the trap frame of the process in a scheduler?

**Answer:** Yes, it's common for a scheduler to store the trap frame of a process. The trap frame, also known as the interrupt stack frame or the exception stack frame, is a data structure that contains the state of the process when an interrupt or exception occurs. The trap frame includes the values of the processor registers, flags, and other state information that is required to resume the execution of the process after the interrupt or exception has been handled.

By storing the trap frame of each process, the scheduler can save and restore the state of each process as it is switched in and out of the CPU, allowing the process to resume execution exactly where it left off. This is an essential component of implementing context switching in a scheduler, as it allows the scheduler to switch between processes without losing the state of the process that was previously running.

When the scheduler is ready to switch to a new process, it saves the current process's trap frame on the process's stack or in a separate data structure, such as a queue. When the scheduler switches to the new process, it restores the new process's trap frame, which sets the state of the processor to the state that the process was in when it was last running.

---

**Question:** How do we store the trap frame

**Answer:** The trap frame can be stored in several ways, depending on the operating system and the architecture of the system. Here are a few common methods:

1.  Stack: One of the simplest methods is to store the trap frame on the process's stack. When an interrupt occurs, the processor pushes the values of the relevant registers and flags onto the stack, creating a stack frame that can be used to store the trap frame. When the scheduler is ready to switch to a different process, it can simply switch to the new process's stack, which will contain the new process's trap frame.
2.  Data structure: The scheduler can also store the trap frame in a dedicated data structure, such as an array or a linked list. When an interrupt occurs, the scheduler can save the trap frame in the data structure and associate it with the relevant process. When the scheduler is ready to switch to a different process, it can simply retrieve the trap frame from the data structure and restore it, which will set the state of the processor to the state that the process was in when it was last running.
3.  Page Table Entry: On some systems, the trap frame can be stored in a page table entry associated with the process. The page table entry can be used to store the state of the process, including the values of the processor registers and flags. When the scheduler is ready to switch to a different process, it can simply modify the page table entry to point to the new process's trap frame, which will set the state of the processor to the state that the process was in when it was last running.   

Regardless of the method used to store the trap frame, it is important to ensure that the trap frame is saved and restored accurately and efficiently, as the trap frame is a critical component of the context switching mechanism used by the scheduler.

**Question:** Should one stack page and one heap page be allocated per process?

**Answer:** In a typical operating system, one stack page and one heap page per process is a common allocation, but the exact number of pages that should be allocated per process depends on the specific requirements of the operating system and the processes being run.

The stack is used to store temporary data, such as function call frames and local variables, and typically grows and shrinks as functions are called and return. The stack size is typically limited, so it's important to allocate enough stack space for each process to handle its maximum depth of function calls.

The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, such as for allocating memory for objects and data structures. The heap size is not typically limited, so a process can allocate more memory from the heap as needed.

In some cases, a single stack page or heap page may be sufficient for a process, while in other cases, multiple pages may be required. The exact number of pages required will depend on the specific requirements of the process, including the amount of temporary data that needs to be stored on the stack and the amount of dynamic memory that will be allocated from the heap.

Ultimately, the decision of how many pages to allocate per process should be based on a trade-off between memory usage and performance. Allocating too few pages can result in out-of-memory errors or stack overflow errors, while allocating too many pages can result in excessive memory usage and decreased performance.

**Question:** How does XV6 does that?

**Answer:** XV6 is a small, simple operating system that was created as a teaching tool for operating system concepts. In XV6, each process is allocated a fixed amount of stack and heap memory. The exact amount of memory allocated for the stack and heap can vary depending on the specific version of XV6 that you are using, but in general, each process is allocated a single page of memory for the stack and a single page of memory for the heap.

The stack in XV6 is implemented as a fixed-size array of bytes, with the stack pointer (SP) pointing to the top of the stack. The stack grows downward, so each time a function is called, the SP is decremented to allocate space for the function call frame. The heap in XV6 is implemented as a dynamically-allocated region of memory, with the heap pointer (HP) pointing to the start of the heap. The heap grows upward, so each time memory is allocated from the heap, the HP is incremented to allocate the requested amount of memory.

When a process is created in XV6, the operating system allocates the stack and heap memory for the process and initializes the SP and HP to point to the start of the stack and heap, respectively. When the process is executed, the stack and heap are used to store temporary data and dynamically-allocated objects, respectively. When the process terminates, the stack and heap memory are freed to be reused by other processes.

In summary, XV6 allocates a fixed amount of memory for the stack and heap of each process and implements the stack and heap as fixed-size arrays and dynamically-allocated regions of memory, respectively. The stack and heap are used to store temporary data and dynamically-allocated objects during the execution of the process.
