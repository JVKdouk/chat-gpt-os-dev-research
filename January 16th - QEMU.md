**Question:** QEMU gave me this CPU exception: v=0d e=0042 i=0 cpl=0 IP=0008:001000d0 pc=001000d0 SP=0010:001ebffc env->regs[R_EAX]=80000011 What could it be?

**Answer:** This appears to be an error message related to a CPU exception that occurred while running QEMU (a type-2 hypervisor that can emulate a wide range of hardware architectures).

The message states that the exception was a "v=0d e=0042", which indicates that the exception was a general protection fault (GPF) with error code 0x42.

The value of the instruction pointer (IP) and program counter (PC) are both "001000d0", which suggests that the exception occurred at a specific memory address. The value of the stack pointer (SP) is "001ebffc".

The value of the EAX register is "80000011", which is not a standard x86 exception vector. This could be an indication of a bug in QEMU.

It is recommended to check the QEMU documentation or forums for more information about this specific error and how to troubleshoot it.

**Question:** When using QEMU monitor and fetching register information, my segment selectors show up as four columns. What does those columns mean?

**Answer:** When you use the QEMU monitor to view the register information, the segment selectors (such as CS, DS, SS, etc.) are displayed in four columns. Each column represents a different bit field of the segment selector:

-   The first column represents the index of the segment descriptor in the GDT or LDT.
-   The second column represents the RPL (Requested Privilege Level) of the segment selector. It is a 2-bit field that specifies the privilege level of the segment. The value of RPL can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
-   The third column represents the TI (Table Indicator) bit of the segment selector. It is a 1-bit field that indicates whether the segment descriptor is in the GDT (global) or LDT (local)
-   The fourth column represents the valid bit of the segment selector. It is a 1-bit field that indicates whether the segment selector points to a valid segment descriptor.

For example, if the value of the CS register is 0x23, the four columns would be 00010(3)0, where the first column is the index of the segment descriptor, the second column is RPL, the third column is TI, and the fourth column is valid bit.

**Question:** Write an inline rust asm that reloads the cs register

**Answer:** Here's an example of inline assembly in Rust that reloads the CS register:

```
#[inline(always)]
unsafe fn reload_cs_register() {
	let cs: u16;
	asm!("mov {}, cs", out(reg) cs);
	asm!("push {}; pop cs", in(reg) cs);
}
```

The first assembly instruction "mov {}, cs" is used to move the value of the CS register into a variable named `cs`.

The second instruction "push {}; pop cs" pushes the value of `cs` onto the stack, then pops it into the CS register. This effectively reloads the CS register with its original value.

It is worth noting that the `#[inline(always)]` attribute is used to tell the Rust compiler to always inline this function, that way the assembly instructions are inserted directly into the calling code, instead of calling the function, this can be useful to avoid function call overhead.

Additionally, the `unsafe` keyword is used to indicate that this function uses assembly instructions, which can be unsafe if not used correctly.

**Question:** Do a ljmp in inline rust asm

**Answer:** Here's an example of using the `ljmp` instruction in inline assembly in Rust:

```
#[inline(always)]
unsafe fn long_jump(segment: u16, offset: u32) {
	asm!("ljmp {}:{}", in(reg) segment, in(reg) offset);
}
```

The `ljmp` instruction performs a far jump to a new code segment and offset. The two arguments passed to the instruction are the new code segment and offset, respectively. In this case, we're passing `segment` and `offset` as the arguments to the instruction.

It is worth noting that the `#[inline(always)]` attribute is used to tell the Rust compiler to always inline this function, that way the assembly instructions are inserted directly into the calling code, instead of calling the function, this can be useful to avoid function call overhead.

Additionally, the `unsafe` keyword is used to indicate that this function uses assembly instructions, which can be unsafe if not used correctly.

Also, This instruction requires that the value of the CS register to be different from the value passed as argument, otherwise a general protection fault will happen.

**Question:** Do a ljmp in inline rust asm using the label 2 and segment 0x08

**Answer:** Here's an example of using the `ljmp` instruction in inline assembly in Rust with a label and a specific segment value:

```
#[inline(always)]
unsafe fn long_jump() {
	asm!("ljmp 0x08, 2f");
	asm!("2:");
}
```

The `ljmp` instruction performs a far jump to a new code segment and offset. In this case, we're passing the segment value of 0x08 and the label "2f" as the arguments to the instruction. The label "2f" is used as a marker for the offset of the instruction, so the jump will be done to this point in the code.

It is worth noting that the `#[inline(always)]` attribute is used to tell the Rust compiler to always inline this function, that way the assembly instructions are inserted directly into the calling code, instead of calling the function, this can be useful to avoid function call overhead.

Additionally, the `unsafe` keyword is used to indicate that this function uses assembly instructions, which can be unsafe if not used correctly.

Also, This instruction requires that the value of the CS register to be different from the value passed as argument, otherwise a general protection fault will happen. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the label is not correctly placed and the jump is not done to a valid instruction.

**Question:** How to hide seabios splashscreen in QEMU serial mode?

**Answer:** Seabios is the default BIOS firmware used in QEMU, and it displays a splash screen when it starts up. To hide this splash screen in QEMU's serial mode, you can use the following command line options:

`-device isa-serial,chardev=my_serial -serial chardev:my_serial -nographic`

The `-device isa-serial,chardev=my_serial` option creates a new serial device and associates it with a character device named `my_serial`. The `-serial chardev:my_serial` option tells QEMU to use this serial device as the primary serial port.

The `-nographic` option tells QEMU to redirect the VGA display to the serial port, so the guest operating system's output will be sent to the serial port instead of being displayed on the screen. This will hide the Seabios splashscreen.

This way, the Seabios splashscreen will not be displayed, the output will be shown on the terminal where QEMU is running.

It is worth noting that when using this option, you will not have access to the graphical interface of the guest operating system, all the interaction will have to be done through the serial port.

---

**Question:** Is there another way?

**Answer:** Another way to hide the Seabios splash screen in QEMU's serial mode is by modifying the Seabios source code and rebuild it. You can disable the splash screen by commenting out or removing the relevant lines of code in the file `vga_init.c` in the Seabios source.

Then, you have to rebuild the Seabios firmware and provide the new firmware to QEMU using the '-bios' option.

This is a more advanced method and requires knowledge of how to build firmware and how Seabios works.

It is worth noting that this method will work even if you are not using QEMU's serial mode and you will still see the output on the screen, but the splash screen will not be displayed.

Also, keep in mind that this process will change the Seabios firmware, and it could lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior if not done properly.

---

**Question:** Is there another way?

**Answer:** An additional way to hide the Seabios splash screen in QEMU's serial mode is by using the QEMU command line option `-display none`. This option disables the display of the guest operating system altogether, so the Seabios splash screen will not be shown. You will not have access to the graphical interface of the guest operating system, all the interaction will have to be done through the serial port, just like the previous option.

You can use this option along with the `-nographic` or `-curses` option to redirect the output to the terminal where QEMU is running.

`-display none -nographic`

or

`-display none -curses`

It is worth noting that this option might have a performance impact, as the guest operating system will not have access to the display hardware, so it will not be able to use the GPU for rendering.
