## Notes of Heap Allocator

ChatGPT correctly points out to heap allocator designs, which ones XV6 uses, and the correct implementation for a Linked List (*dlmalloc*) Allocator. ChatGPT supreends by even showing how to write an Allocator in Rust using a page allocation system, instead of the common static memory region.

One of the problems of ChatGPT becomes evident when we ask it for external articles on the matter. All of the five articles provided either do not exist, or are not valid anymore. ChatGPT can be a powerful experience in Operating System development, as long as external internet links are not required.

**Question:** Give me some heap allocator designs

**Answer:** Here are several heap allocator designs:

1.  Buddy allocator: uses a binary tree to keep track of free blocks and quickly allocate and deallocate blocks.
2.  Slab allocator: caches blocks of the same size to avoid fragmentation and improve allocation performance.
3.  Segregated fits allocator: divides memory into multiple bins, each storing blocks of a specific size.
4.  ptmalloc (glibc's allocator): a multi-threaded allocator that uses a combination of segregated fits and thread-local caching.
5.  dlmalloc: a general-purpose allocator that uses a "best-fit" strategy to allocate memory.
6.  Hoard allocator: uses a combination of per-thread caching and central caching to reduce lock contention in multi-threaded programs.

**Question:** What design does XV6 use?

**Answer:** The Xv6 operating system uses the dlmalloc heap allocator design.

Give me a pseudo-code on how to implement dlmalloc

Here is a basic outline of how you could implement dlmalloc in pseudo-code:

```
struct block {
  size_t size;
  struct block *next;
  struct block *prev;
  int free;
  char data[1];
};

#define ALIGNMENT 16
#define HEADER_SIZE (sizeof(struct block))
#define MIN_BLOCK_SIZE (HEADER_SIZE + ALIGNMENT)

void *base = NULL;

void *malloc(size_t size) {
  if (base == NULL) {
    base = sbrk(0);
    sbrk(MIN_BLOCK_SIZE);
    base->size = MIN_BLOCK_SIZE;
    base->next = NULL;
    base->prev = NULL;
    base->free = 0;
  }

  struct block *current = base;
  while (current->next != NULL) {
    if (current->free && current->size >= size + HEADER_SIZE) {
      current->free = 0;
      return current->data;
    }
    current = current->next;
  }

  struct block *new_block = sbrk(size + HEADER_SIZE);
  new_block->size = size + HEADER_SIZE;
  new_block->next = NULL;
  new_block->prev = current;
  new_block->free = 0;
  current->next = new_block;

  return new_block->data;
}

void free(void *ptr) {
  struct block *block_ptr = (struct block*)ptr - 1;
  block_ptr->free = 1;
}
```

Note that this is just a basic outline and dlmalloc has many more features and optimizations in practice.

**Question:** Does this allocator design uses a linked list?

**Answer:** Yes, the dlmalloc allocator design uses a linked list to keep track of the blocks of memory that are available for allocation or have been freed. The `base` pointer points to the first block in the linked list and each block has pointers to its next and previous blocks. The malloc function iterates through the linked list to find a suitable block to allocate, and the free function updates the status of a block to indicate that it has been freed and can be used for future allocations.

**Question:** How to create an allocator in Rust that uses pages instead of a static memory address for heap limits?

**Answer:** In Rust, you can create a custom allocator that uses pages for memory allocation by implementing the `GlobalAlloc` trait from the `alloc` crate. The basic idea is to allocate pages of memory as needed and divide them into smaller blocks for individual allocations. Here is a simple example of a page-based allocator:

```
use core::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout};
use core::ptr::null_mut;

const PAGE_SIZE: usize = 4096;

struct PageAllocator;

unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for PageAllocator {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
        if layout.size() == 0 {
            return null_mut();
        }

        let size = layout.size() + layout.padding_needed_for(PAGE_SIZE);
        let pages = size / PAGE_SIZE + (size % PAGE_SIZE != 0) as usize;
        let ptr = libc::mmap(null_mut(), pages * PAGE_SIZE, libc::PROT_READ | libc::PROT_WRITE, libc::MAP_PRIVATE | libc::MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);

        if ptr == libc::MAP_FAILED {
            return null_mut();
        }

        ptr as *mut u8
    }

    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {
        let size = layout.size() + layout.padding_needed_for(PAGE_SIZE);
        let pages = size / PAGE_SIZE + (size % PAGE_SIZE != 0) as usize;
        libc::munmap(ptr as *mut libc::c_void, pages * PAGE_SIZE);
    }
}

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOCATOR: PageAllocator = PageAllocator;
```

This allocator uses the `mmap` function to allocate pages of memory, and the `munmap` function to deallocate pages. The `Layout` struct passed to the `alloc` and `dealloc` methods describes the size and alignment of the block being allocated or deallocated.

The `#[global_allocator]` attribute sets this allocator as the default allocator for the entire program.
